Vite has been focused on performance since its [origins](./why.md). Its dev server architecture allows HMR that stays fast as projects scale. Vite uses native tools like [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) and [SWC](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/tree/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) to implement intensive tasks but keeps the rest of the code in JS to balance speed with flexibility. When needed, framework plugins will tap into [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to compile user code. And during build time Vite currently uses [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) where bundling size and having access to a wide ecosystem of plugins are more important than raw speed. Vite will continue to evolve internally, using new libraries as they appear to improve DX while keeping its API stable.
