[WMR](https://github.com/preactjs/wmr) by the Preact team looked to provide a similar feature set. Vite's universal Rollup plugin API for dev and build was inspired by it.
WMR is no longer maintained. The Preact team now recommends Vite with [@preactjs/preset-vite](https://github.com/preactjs/preset-vite).
