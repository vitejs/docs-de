If neither of these fit your needs, you can specify custom entries using this option - the value should be a [fast-glob pattern](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob#basic-syntax) or array of patterns that are relative from Vite project root. This will overwrite default entries inference. Only `node_modules` and `build.outDir` folders will be ignored by default when `optimizeDeps.entries` is explicitly defined. If other folders need to be ignored, you can use an ignore pattern as part of the entries list, marked with an initial `!`. If you don't want to ignore `node_modules` and `build.outDir`, you can specify using literal string paths (without fast-glob patterns) instead.
If neither of these fit your needs, you can specify custom entries using this option - the value should be a [`tinyglobby` pattern](https://superchupu.dev/tinyglobby/comparison) or array of patterns that are relative from Vite project root. This will overwrite default entries inference. Only `node_modules` and `build.outDir` folders will be ignored by default when `optimizeDeps.entries` is explicitly defined. If other folders need to be ignored, you can use an ignore pattern as part of the entries list, marked with an initial `!`. `node_modules` will not be ignored for patterns that explicitly include the string `node_modules`.
